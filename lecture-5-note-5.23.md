Spoken informally could implemented by different systems



Key word: synmatic preserved transformation

represent the behavior: flow chart, behavior chart, sudo code



User scenario === test case

User scenario could never be completed, for consecutive input in real world



label of state don't affect the result

equivalent state => ===

State ^i^ and State ^j^ are equivalent if and only if:

criteria 1:  State ^i^ output === State ^j^ output
criteria 2: State^*^~i~ and State^*^~j~ are same (^*^ means the all next state of the current state)

So for example:
A -> B(1) && A -> D(0) and D -> B(1) && D-> E(0) 
if C === E
A === D

**after optimization

then the system could describe into flowchart

then could have many implemention of differnt system
