### Properties for Good HCI

+ "**Cool**": i.e. Not-standard (within the basic need for user, but could have some surprise)
+ Could be "**Intuitive**"
+ Direct manipulation
+ proper **CD (control display) ratio**. One famous Company is XEROX PARC for interface design (desktop metaphor) Drag-drop



### Properties for bad HCI (each point oppose the upper point)

- Non-standard, violate the basic users' expectation 

  e.g.: slow / unreliable / unstable

- hard to know the state of work

  two principle from "Don Norman"

  + gulf of **evaluation**
  + gulf of **execution**

  E.G.: hard to find the entry of send email(most for **evaluation** to long)

- violates **SR**( short for **Stimulus Response**) compatibility 

  + E.G.1 : "RED" in green font 
  + E.G.2: Drive the boat, turn controller left to turn the boat right



(cognition) Human to Computer: execution

Computer to Human: evaluation



**Navigation** 

E.G.: Scrollbar



**Manipulation**:

E.G.:Joystick

### HCI is tools, which also means stimulation of the real world.

Tools === usability === utility

several opposite properties for Interface

+ Novice <==> Expert
+ generic(ill-posed ) <==> specialized(well-posed)



#### several example of 4 different categories

Novice and Generic:

+ Drag-Drop

Novice and Specialized:

+ paint

Specialized and expert

+ Visual Studio( in some case )

Expert and generic

+ Command Line Interface

Software Engineering: Design Methodology

Could Apply on:

+ Waterfall
+ Agile
