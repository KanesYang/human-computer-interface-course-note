### Introduction 

#### what is Engineering?

Engineering put the **theory** into **application**

**Enginnering** : 
- Systematic methodology for the desgin of systems (bring something together, a system that could stand by self) 
- use some ideas to solve problems
- as a commodity, also meaning could earn the money
- another important issue is to serve the public safety

#### an idea?

- synthesis means put all the things together

####extension:
1. **Selection** **(event to change state) ==type: boolean==** : button, switch, checkbox, radio button, menu
2. **quantifier** **(we could the exact quantity of user action) ==type:int / float could also understand in 1D space==**: knob, scrollbar
3. **tuples / position** **(user action in a 2D or 3D space) ==type:tuples==** : mouse, touchscreen, Wii controller(3D space)
4. **text** **==type:string==**: keyboard
5. ==there is no more other extension of human computer interface!!!==

####Definition:

some physical or virtual items, widgets

####API:
API = a set of ==Objects== (contains modules, classes, attributes)

programming interface also known as a set of method name which define the input name and out name

#####Interface: a 2D space that separate 3D space

the **interface** of "programming **interface**" and "user **interface**" ==actually the same thing!!!==
